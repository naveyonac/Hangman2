# Hangman 2

Two Player Game

## Instructions
For this game, player one will pick a word. Player two will then try to guess the word before the hanging man image is displayed. For each wrong letter guess, a body part will be added to the figure.

## Technologies Used
This game was built using HTML CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. Everything was then bundled together using parcel.

### Unsolved Issues
There are two issues that I am currently having that I am trying to work through. The first being I am only able to grab the first repeating letter in a word (for example 'hello' I would only be able to display the first 'l'). I need to find a way to loop through the chosen word and check each indicie and see if the letter appears in other places.  The second issue being able to display when the player has won.
