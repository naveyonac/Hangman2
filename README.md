# Hangman 2

Two Player Game

## Instructions
For this game, player one will pick a word. Player two will then try to guess the word before the hanging man image is displayed. For each wrong letter guess, a body part will be added to the figure.

## Technologies Used
This game was built using HTML CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. Everything was then bundled together using parcel.

### Currently Working On
I am currently trying to add a single player mode that will have an object containing(hopefully) tens of thousands of words that will allow the user to play by themself.
